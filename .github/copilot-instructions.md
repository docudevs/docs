## Repo Scope
- Static documentation site built with Docusaurus 3; everything routes through `docusaurus.config.ts` and `sidebars.ts`.
- Two doc streams: curated guides in `docs/**` and generated API references under `docs/openapi/**`.
- Home page lives in `src/pages/index.tsx` and immediately redirects to `docs/intro` to make docs the entry point.

## Running Docs
- Use Node 18+ and Yarn; bootstrap with `yarn`.
- `yarn start` serves live docs with hot reload; rely on this to spot MDX or sidebar issues quickly.
- `yarn build` validates production output; run before shipping large doc restructures.
- `yarn typecheck` covers the small TS/React surface (custom theme, homepage components).

## Content Conventions
- Author new guides in `docs/<area>/...` with frontmatter (`title`, `sidebar_position`) so sidebars stay predictable.
- Keep MDX imports (e.g., `@theme/Tabs`) at top of file and prefer async Python examples, matching current SDK snippets.
- Cross-link docs using absolute `/docs/...` URLs; verify targets exist because sidebars currently reference some missing `integration/*` pages.
- Store shared assets under `static/img` or `static/files`; Docusaurus copies them during build.

## Sidebar & Navigation
- Update `sidebars.ts` when adding guide content; IDs map to file paths (`docs/basics/SimpleDocuments.md` -> `basic/SimpleDocuments`).
- Sidebar slugs are case-sensitive; ensure filenames and sidebar entries (e.g., `templates/Templates`) stay aligned.
- API sidebar is autogenerated from the OpenAPI plugin configuration—avoid manual edits in `docs/openapi/sidebar.ts` unless you intend to override generation.

## OpenAPI Workflow
- Source OpenAPI spec lives at `static/files/docudevs.yaml`.
- Regenerate API docs with `yarn api-docs` (runs clean + gen); it overwrites `docs/openapi/**/*.mdx` and keeps method grouping defined in `docusaurus.config.ts`.
- Do not hand-edit generated API MDX; adjust the YAML spec or plugin config instead.

## Theming & Components
- All docs use the `@theme/ApiItem` component set in `docusaurus.config.ts`; keep overrides under `src/theme`.
- Custom React lives in `src/components` (currently only `HomepageFeatures`)—extend here if you need reusable MDX components.

## Samples & Tests
- `tests/curl` and `tests/python` hold example payloads/assets referenced in docs; treat them as fixtures, not executable automated tests.
- `build/` and `.docusaurus/` (ignored) are generated outputs—never edit by hand.

## Review Checklist for Changes
- After editing docs, run `yarn start` to confirm sidebar labels, imported components, and code tabs render correctly.
- If touching API docs, run `yarn api-docs` then `yarn build` to ensure the generated markdown compiles.
- Watch for broken absolute links introduced by renames; Docusaurus only warns on build, not start.
