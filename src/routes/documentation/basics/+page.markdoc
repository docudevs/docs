## Principles

There are 4 items you can send to the API:
1. The document to be processed (mandatory)
2. The schema to be used (optional)
3. Processing instructions for the data (optional)
4. Configuration options (optional)

If you don't specify the schema or the configuration, the API will use sensible defaults for them.

## Example 1 - Invoice - minimal using just the document
![example invoice](./invoice-screenshot.png)

This invoice is saved as `invoice.pdf`. You can send it to the API using the following command:

```sh
curl -s -S -X POST https://api.docudevs.ai/document/upload-files \
     -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" \
     -F "document=@invoice.pdf"
```

This will give you the result of the document being processed using the default schema and configuration.
```json

    "page_number": "1/10"
  }
}
```

## Example 2 - Invoice - provide instructions

Previous example provided a lot of data and fields. Maybe you only need few fields from the invoice? 

You can create an instructions file and send it to the API. This file is free-formatted text, that you can
fill in any language. 

Example of instructions file that we name `instructions.txt`:
```
I need: IBAN, reference-number, account-owner, 
account-address and total amount from this invoice.
```

Send the instructions together with the document to the api:
```sh
curl -s -S -X POST https://api.docudevs.ai/document/upload-files \
     -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" \
     -F "document=@invoice.pdf" \
     -F "instructions=@instructions.txt"
```

This will give you the results that you specified in the instructions.txt:

```json
{
  "iban": "CH64 3196 1000 0044 2155 7",
  "reference_number": "00 00082 07791 22585 74212 86694",
  "account_owner": "Max Muster & S\u00f6hne",
  "account_address": "Musterstrasse 123 8000 Seldwyla",
  "total_amount": "CHF 50.00"
}
```

## Example 3 - Invoice - provide schema

Previous example provided nicely only the data fields that we are interested in.
But what if we want to have the data in a specific format? To integrate it with our system we need the data in a specific format.
For example the previous example gave us the total amount as a string "50.00 CHF". But we want to have it as a number.

The schema is given in [JSON-Schema](https://json-schema.org/) format. 
To create a schema, you can just ask ChatGPT to do it for you from a given example.

Let's use the previous answer as an example. We want to have the total amount as a number, and 
the address split into street, postal code and city.

The json-schema for this would look like this (as created by chat-gpt):
```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "iban": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "International Bank Account Number",
      "pattern": "^[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{2} [0-9]{4} [0-9]{4} [0-9]{4} [0-9]{4} [0-9]$"
    },
    "reference_number": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Reference number for the transaction",
      "pattern": "^[0-9]{2} [0-9]{5} [0-9]{5} [0-9]{5} [0-9]{5} [0-9]{5}$"
    },
    "account_owner": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Name of the account owner"
    },
    "account_address": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "street": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Street name and number of the account owner's address"
        },
        "postal_code": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Postal code of the account owner's address",
          "pattern": "^[0-9]{4}$"
        },
        "city": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "City of the account owner's address"
        }
      },
      "required": ["street", "postal_code", "city"],
      "description": "Address of the account owner split into components"
    },
    "total_amount": {
      "type": "number",
      "description": "Total amount in CHF"
    }
  },
  "required": ["iban", "reference_number", "account_owner", "account_address", "total_amount"]
}
```
Let's store this schema in a file called `schema.json` and send it to the API together with the document:

**Note we don't need to specify the instructions in this case**

```sh
curl -s -S -X POST https://api.docudevs.ai/document/upload-files \
     -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" \
     -F "document=@invoice.pdf" \
     -F "schema=@schema.json"
```

This will give you the results:

```json
{
  "iban": "CH64 3196 1000 0044 2155 7",
  "reference_number": "00 00082 07791 22585 74212 86694",
  "account_owner": "Max Muster & S\u00f6hne",
  "account_address": {
    "street": "Musterstrasse 123",
    "postal_code": "8000",
    "city": "Seldwyla"
  },
  "total_amount": 50.0
}
```

## Example 3 - Invoice - QR Code

The previous examples showed how to extract data from an invoice. But what if you want to extract the QR code as well?

For this we would need to set a configuration parameter. The configuration is a JSON object that can contain various settings for the processing.

we create a configuration file `config.json` with the following content:
```json
{
  "barcodes": true
}
```

Let's have an instructions file `instructions.txt` that say we only want the QR code:
```
I need: QR code from this invoice.
```
Let's send them to the API together with the document:
```sh
curl -s -S -X POST https://api.docudevs.ai/document/upload-files \
     -H "Authorization: $API_KEY" \
     -F "document=@invoice.pdf" \
     -F "instructions=@instructions.txt" \
     -F "metadata=@config.json"
```
This will give you the results:

```json

{
  "QRCode": [
    "SPC",
    "0200",
    "1",
    "CH6431961000004421557",
    "S",
    "Max Muster & S\u00f6hne",
    "Musterstrasse",
    "123",
    "8000",
    "Seldwyla",
    "CH",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "",
    "50.00",
    "CHF",
    "S",
    "Simon Muster",
    "Musterstrasse",
    "1",
    "8000",
    "Seldwyla",
    "CH",
    "QRR",
    "000008207791225857421286694",
    "Payment of travel",
    "EPD"
  ]
}

```
